# In this project we will be scraping data about dental clinics in the US

## In the basic.py file we are extracting the data using the Yelp api . It contains Name,Address,Phone,Rating and Review Count

## In the advanced.py we add a couple features and extract Company Name,Address,Phone,Rating,Review_Count,Management Team,Email,Website ( though the output is sometimes inaccurate)

## In the complete.py file we are extracting the complete data using google maps api , facebook api and linked in api . It requires quite a bit of setup and access to all those API's . Hence I've left some of the implementation empty.
